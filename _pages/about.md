I’m a Computer Science student at UCSB with a strong background in full-stack development, distributed systems, and AI/ML integration. I’m passionate about building intuitive frontends, scalable backends, and cloud-native architectures.

I’ve built projects ranging from an AI-powered Tariff Calculator using FastAPI + FAISS, to a real-time chat app (Chattr) using React, Node.js, and WebSockets. My work often focuses on how AI and automation can simplify complex workflows for both developers and consumers.

Outside of coding, I’m fascinated by finance, entrepreneurship, and product design — I love exploring how data and technology intersect to create scalable, human-centered solutions.
